# Overview

The BitFi Points Program is now live! Earn points by holding bfBTC, inviting friends, and completing tasks with ecosystem partners. BitFi token airdrops are coming in the future!

&#x20;Explore the BitFi point at [https://app.bitfi.one/points-program](https://app.bitfi.one/points-program).



## **Key Features**

* **Referral Tracking:** Track users you have invited, see which referrals are valid (i.e., have earned points), and view your own referrer address.
* **Unified Points:** Instantly view your total points and a detailed breakdown, including previously distributed Galxe points, referral points, holding points, and points from ecosystem partners.
* **Transparent Points Breakdown:** On the Activity page, view all point-earning records, filterable by chain and activity type.
* **Quick Guide:** The Quest page provides an overview of all available quests and direct links to complete them.



## **Types of Points**

* **bfBTC HODL Points:** Earn 10 points for every 0.0001 bfBTC you hold per epoch.
* **Referral Points:** For every 10 HODL points earned by your referred users, you receive 1 point.
* **Galxe Points:** Earn points by completing Galxe quests. Galxe points will be distributed in phases (including Galxe HODL and Social Task points).
* **Ecosystem Partner Points:** Earn points by participating in partner projects, provided you meet specific criteria.



## **How to Earn Points**

* At the end of each epoch, BitFi will take a snapshot of user balances and distribute points to eligible users.
* Each epoch lasts approximately 24 hours (one snapshot per day).
* Points are distributed as whole numbers only (no decimals).
* For example, if you hold 0.00018 bfBTC, you will receive 10 points per epoch (not 18 points).
