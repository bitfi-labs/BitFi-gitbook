# FAQ

## **What is bfBTC?**

bfBTC is BitFi protocol's real-yield bearing token that provides native BTC rewards for Bitcoin holders while enhancing liquidity in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Through BitFi quantitative strategies, bfBTC delivers continuous BTC rewards to its holders.



## **How does bfBTC work?**

BitFi partners with Ceffu to custody user-deposited Bitcoin. Under multi-party supervision, these funds are deployed in BitFi's quantitative strategies to generate yields. The earnings are regularly updated to the bfBTC ratio (exchange rate), allowing users to accumulate yields once they exchange their BTC for bfBTC.



## **How can I stake on Bitcoin Network?**

For Bitcoin network stakes, start by connecting your Bitcoin wallet. Next, select your desired receiving network and connect your EVM wallet to complete the stake. Please note that Bitcoin network stakes require 6 block confirmations (about 1 hour) before bfBTC is sent to your EVM wallet.



## **How can I stake on EVM network?**

For EVM network (ETH, BASE, BSC, HEMI, etc..) stakes. Just connect your wallet and make sure you have BTC(Bitlayer Native Token), BTCB(BSC BEP20), or hemiBTC(Hemi ERC20) along with enough gas fees for the network transaction.



## **How to unstake to Bitcoin?**

To unstake, start by connecting your EVM wallet. Select 'Bitcoin' as your Receive network in the unstake section and connect your Bitcoin wallet to receive the funds. Please note that unstake requests require processing time. Once completed, you'll receive Bitcoin directly to your Bitcoin address while the bfBTC is burned.



## **How to unstake to EVM network?**

To unstake, connect your EVM wallet and select BSC(Binance Smart Chain), BTR(Bitlayer) or HEMI(Hemi network) as your Receive network. Please note that unstake requests require processing time. Once completed, your bfBTC will be burned, and you can claim your BTCB, BTC or hemiBTC from the 'Claim' section.



## **Why is my received BTC amount different after unstake?**

bfBTC's ratio(exchange rate) changes with each Epoch. Since unstake require processing time, the Epoch during execution may differ from when you initiated the request, causing a slight difference between your expected and actual receive amount.



## **What is Epoch & Ratio?**

An Epoch is the minimum timeframe between bfBTC exchange rate updates, which is currently 24 hours. The bfBTC ratio updates with each new Epoch. The Ratio indicates how much BTC you can receive for 1 bfBTC during the current Epoch.



## **What is Est. Rewards?**

Estimated rewards are calculated based on the ratio difference between your deposit time and withdrawal request time. However, rewards from unstake requests in Pending status are not included in Est. rewards, which may result in some differences from your actual rewards.



## What is the Fee?

BitFi charges a fee when users make unstake. The fee is mainly used to cover the cost of processing unstake. Currently, the BitFi fees are as follows:

* **Native Withdraw (Unstake to Bitcoin Network):** 0.000012 bfBTC
* **EVM Withdraw (Unstake to EVM Network):** 0.000006 bfBTC



## What are BitFi Points?

BitFi Points are the reward points of BitFi's points program. Users can participate in various activities to earn points at [https://app.bitfi.one/points-program](https://app.bitfi.one/points-program). Based on the number of points earned, BitFi Tokens will be airdropped in the future. You can earn points by inviting others to join with your referral code and hold bfBTC, by holding bfBTC yourself, or by participating in ecosystem projects.
