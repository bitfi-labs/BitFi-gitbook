### bfBTC

bfBTC represents BitFi's native route for Bitcoin holders to unlock CeDeFi yields. The token is minted when BTC is bridged on-chain, then deployed into mirror trading, liquidity, and DeFi strategies coordinated by Ceffu's MirrorX engine. The resulting revenue—combined with protocol-level incentives—is distributed back to bfBTC holders, so the token's exchange ratio steadily grows while remaining redeemable 1:1 for native BTC across chains.

### bfUSD

bfUSD is a fully collateralized USD stablecoin minted from USDT and USDC with Chainlink-secured pricing. Holders can stake bfUSD into the low-risk Horizon pool (hbfUSD) or the higher-yield Pulsar pool (pbfUSD), each operating as ERC-4626 vaults with target APYs (15% for hbfUSD, 22% for pbfUSD). Yield stems from the pooled staking revenue, cross-pool insurance buffers, and boosted distributions from the Horizon pool, while redemption paths (standard and instant) preserve capital stability.
