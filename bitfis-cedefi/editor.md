# Integration with CeFi and DeFi

## **CeFi Integration**

BitFi seamlessly integrates with centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Binance via Ceffu's MirrorX service. Upon deposit, BitFi transfers funds to a Ceffu Prime Wallet, mirroring them at a 1:1 ratio to a Binance MirrorX sub-account without requiring users to directly interact with the CEX. This approach is accessible to all Bitcoin holders, regardless of experience level.

## **DeFi Integration**

BitFi issues liquidity staking tokens, bfBTC and bfUSD, allowing users to earn CeFi yields while simultaneously utilizing these tokens within other DeFi protocols for activities like swapping and lending. This dual approach generates additional on-chain yields. Users can redeem their LST tokens at any time, exchanging bfBTC and bfUSD for BTC on their chosen blockchain.
