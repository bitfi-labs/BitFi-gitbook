# Contract ABI

The ABI of bfBTC contracts can be categorized into two types, with slight differences between them:

* Contracts that use ERC20 assets as underlying assets
* Contracts that use Gas Tokens as underlying assets



1. Contracts that use ERC20 assets as underlying assets

{% file src="../../.gitbook/assets/bfBTC-contract-ABI-erc20.json" %}



2. Contracts that use Gas Tokens as underlying assets (Only on Bitlayer)

{% file src="../../.gitbook/assets/bfBTC-contract-ABI-gasToken (1).json" %}



All contracts have been verified on their respective network explorers. You can also interact with the contracts directly through the appropriate block explorer for each network.
