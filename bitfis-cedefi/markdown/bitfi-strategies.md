# BitFi Strategies

BitFi partners with several professional quantitative teams, employing a stable delta-neutral strategy to generate consistent returns.\
BitFi utilizes a sophisticated delta-neutral strategy to generate consistent BTC yield for users. Unlike traditional investment approaches susceptible to market volatility, our strategy minimizes price fluctuation exposure while maximizing returns. This is achieved through a dynamically adjusted portfolio maintaining a net delta of zero.\


## **Core Strategy Components:**

* **Delta-Neutral Hedging:** A core component of our strategy involves creating a delta-neutral portfolio by precisely matching long positions in Bitcoin-correlated assets with short positions in derivative contracts (e.g., perpetual swaps, futures). This dynamic hedging minimizes exposure to market volatility.
* **Yield Generation:** While delta-neutral hedging mitigates price risk, BitFi generates yield through:
  * **Funding Rates:** Capitalizing on positive funding rates from perpetual swap contracts.&#x20;
  * **Basis Spreads:** Exploiting favorable discrepancies between spot and derivative market prices.&#x20;
  * **Staking Rewards (where applicable):** Integrating staking rewards from underlying assets.
