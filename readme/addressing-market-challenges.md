# Addressing Market Challenges

BitFi addresses major pain points facing on-chain asset management and yield generation:

1. **Limited Access to Quality Yields:**\
   Most platforms offer either CeFi or DeFi yields, but rarely both in a seamless and transparent way.
2. **Complex User Experience:**\
   Navigating multiple protocols and cross-chain operations is often complicated and inefficient for users.
3. **Fragmented Investment Strategies:**\
   Yield opportunities are often siloed, making diversified and optimized returns hard to achieve.

2. **Seamless Asset Management:**\
