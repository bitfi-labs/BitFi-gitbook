# bfBTC Overview

## Introduction

bfBTC is BitFi's cross-chain Bitcoin liquidity staking solution, allowing users to securely stake Bitcoin assets (including BTC, BTCB, and hemiBTC) across multiple blockchain networks and mint bfBTC at real-time exchange rates. Users can redeem their staked assets with accrued yields by burning bfBTC.

**Technical Foundation**

bfBTC is built on an enhanced ERC-20 standard (supporting cross-chain transactions through LayerZero OFT standard) and functions as a multichain Bitcoin-backed token.&#x20;

**Key Advantages**

* **Multichain Interoperability**: Use bfBTC on Ethereum, BSC, Bitlayer, Hemi, Base, Core, and Goat;
* **Yield Generation**: Earn returns through protocol revenue sharing and liquidity staking incentives;
* **Risk Mitigation**: Assets are held in custody with Ceffu and deployed in yield-generating strategies with capped volatility risk.

bfBTC establishes a trust-minimized bridge for Bitcoin to participate in multichain DeFi, combining:

* The **liquidity** of Bitcoin
